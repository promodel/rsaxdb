Database to store, search and retrieve DNA physical properties profiles has been developed and its use for analysis of E. coli promoters has been demonstrated. Unique feature of the database is in its ability to handle whole profile as single internal object type in a way similar to integers or character strings. To demonstrate utility of such database it was populated with data of 1227 known promoters, their nucleotide sequence, profile of electrostatic potential, transcription factor binding sites. Each promoter is also connected to all genes, whose transcription is controlled by that promoter. Source code of profile datatype and dump of the database together with R/Bioconductor library is available from authors by request
